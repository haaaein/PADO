# 🐋 PADO: Personality-induced multi-Agents for Detecting OCEAN

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to **PADO**, a novel multi-agent framework designed for detecting personality traits (OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) from human-generated texts. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), PADO employs agents with distinct personality-induced perspectives to deliver context-aware and nuanced insights into personality traits.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Personality Induction**: Agents are induced with varying personality traits to offer diverse perspectives.
- **Psycholinguistic Insight**: Agents analyze emotional, cognitive, and social dimensions for comprehensive assessments.
- **Comparative Judgment**: A judge agent synthesizes contrasting analyses for accurate and balanced evaluations.

## 🛠️ Setup
Follow these easy steps to set up PADO:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haaaein/PADO.git

## 📈 Performance
PADO consistently surpasses traditional methods:
- Robust and reliable personality detection.
- Strong effectiveness even with smaller LLMs such as LLaMA3-8B and Solar-10.7B-Instruct.
